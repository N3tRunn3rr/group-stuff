## Perfect Playlist (B...P..M..?)

## Project Description
An app that allows the user to choose the genre, decade, and target tempo based on the activity they would like to accomplish. 

## User Story

As a user I want a playlist that matches the specifications I set based on the intensity of the activity.

This is done when. 

I select a genre, decade, and acitvity based on target heart rate (range) and determine the length of the playlist. Then I click generate to populate the playlist.

As a user I should be able to select if the music can be explicit or not.

This is done by moving the toggle button on the site. If the user selects explicit listneing UI will go to dark mode.
