## User Story

As a user I want a playlist that matches the specifications I set based on the intensity of the activity.

This is done when. 

I select an acitvity, a genre, and how many songs I want on the playlist. Then I submit the creiteria to populate the playlist.

As a user I should be able to select if the music can be explicit or not.

This is done by moving the toggle button on the site. If the user selects explicit listneing UI will go to dark mode.
